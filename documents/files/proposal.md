## `Main Goals`

To generate tangles from a grammar and a set of geometric, grouping and decorative operators in a seamless manner. 

### Goals Within The Implementation

### 1. `Grammar`

In the implementation shapes are arbitrary two dimensional polygons with holes, where their boundaries are represented as highly-tessellated closed curves.

The core idea is that all the grammar operators work on groups of shapes, both in input and output. We aim to use code to represent tangle grammars which explicitly express the grouping information of every shape, in a way that this information is directly accessible and modifiable by specific operators.

### 2. `Operators`

We aim to code the compact set of operators that are efficient, closed under any set of arbitrary shapes, and that are able to encode a wide amount of variations in the generated tangles as proposed in the paper. There are several operators that work on the grammar and they are broadly divided into three types:

-  Grouping operators: Grouping between the drawn shapes, rearranging them in a meaningful manner, that can also be independent from the step at which such shapes were created.
    
    - Ungroup operator : Takes all shapes in S and assigns a new group id to each one.
    -  Regroup operator: Rearranges the shapes of a selected group into multiple newly created groups

-  Geometric operators: Subdivide shape groups by splitting, outlining and placing objects in them.
    - Regular Split
    - Geometric Outline
    - Streamline Split
    - Shape Placement

-  Decorative operators: Modify the final appearance of a shape, without further subdivisions.
    - Filling: Sets the background color of a shape
    - Stippling: Stipples the shape with geometrical details like dots, dashes, curves

### 3. `Shape Perturbation`

Simulating the organic feel of our generated tangles by applying a perturbation for all subdivided shapes.

## `Problem Definition`

### What is the problem?
Tangles are a form of structured two dimensional art characterized by repeating, recursive patterns. The aim is to procedurally generate realistic tangle drawings controlled by users using a shape grammar. 

The tangles are formally modelled with group grammars that explicitly handle the grouping of shapes necessary to represent tangle repetitions. A small set of expressive geometric, grouping and decorative operators are used to show that they can respectively express complex tangles patterns and sub-pattern distributions, with relatively simple grammars.  We aim to validate the results of the paper which shows how group grammars can produce a wide variety of patterns in a few seconds which on the flip side would take artists hours of tedious and time consuming work. 

### How things will be done?

The code will be written for the processing of grammars and operators will be written in `Python`, the grammars and shapes will be represented using `JSON` in a readable manner, and all tangles for both input and output will be created in the `SVG` format.

## `Results`
### What will be done?

The proposed ideas in the paper regarding the grammars, operators and shape perturbation required to make artictic tangles will be implemented.

### Final outcome

A system that is able to generate tangles automatically, starting from any initial set of shapes. This tool can be used for the  automatic generation of an organic looking tangle.

## `Datasets`

A dataset of grammars to generate the tangles is required for the implementation of the proposed algorithm.

A set of output images is required to show the possible tangles generated by the program.

### Obtaining the datasets?

Since this dataset is not available online, we plan to contact the authors as a the first option. In the event that this does not succeed we will synthesise the shapes and grammars in a random fashion as `JSON` files.
